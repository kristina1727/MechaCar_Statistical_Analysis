## Overview

## Linear Regression to Predict MGP
Based on the linear regression summary show below we are able to identify 2 of the variables/coefficients stand out as being statistically significate. Both vehicle_length and ground_clearance show a p-value of less than .05, meaning the results not random and we would not at this time be able to accept the null hypothesis.

We are also able to conclude that the slope for the linear model would not zero. If you were to look at the two statistically significant variables as noted above you can see the slope (estimate) is greater than 6 and has a p-value of 2.60e-12 leading to the conclusion that that our slope is not zero.

Another item we can identify from the linear model is more effective at predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The can be identified by looking at the r-squared value of .6825. As this is closer to 1 than 0, we can determine that there the relationship between the model and the dependant variable is relatively strong.
